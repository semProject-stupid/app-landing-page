to check:
-> why webpage not entire screen?

to add:
-> blinking movement in welcome to spaze, like moving l to r
-> in welcome, cute animation other than blinking circles 
- the movement of heading and stuff when the page is first loaded

to fix:
-> why the links arent aligned (privacy policy/app etc) when screen shrinks
-> sub-footer text wont wrap properly
-> weird spacing in main footer
-> footer is breaking when screen narrows (temp fix in footer with width 100% and overflow x hidden; sorry i had forgotten flexwrap on one of the parent divs)
-> once u start scrolling the collapsed nav menu disappears

new stuff:
- align items center in the body (direction column) was keeping the divs from taking up the entire webpage;
keep it align items stretch
- max width 100% and flex-wrap: wrap imp!
- window.location.hash = #id
- doc.getlementbyId
- using input id and label for, as well as positioning and ~ selector for collapsing nav menu
- do NOT add fixed widths. containers break. add width 100% then max-width whatever u want
- using vw and vh 
- input:focus
