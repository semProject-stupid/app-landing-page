to check:
-> why webpage not entire screen?

to add:

to fix:
- why the links arent aligned (privacy policy/app etc) when screen shrinks
- sub-footer text wont wrap properly
-> weird spacing in main footer
-> footer is breaking when screen narrows (temp fix in footer with width 100% and overflow x hidden; sorry i had forgotten flexwrap on one of the parent divs)

new stuff:
- align items center in the body (direction column) was keeping the divs from taking up the entire webpage;
keep it align items stretch
- max width 100% and flex-wrap: wrap imp!
