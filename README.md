## About:
This is a landing page for a sports app; it was made while I was learning flexbox, animations, and positioning.

###### Note:
    - In the style.css file border rules were used extensively during development; they have been commented out but not removed for the sake of easier debugging. 
    - User's theme preferences are not remembered. 
    - The gifs marquee / infinite scroll in "type" section are not responsive for smaller screens.
